# This project is close to completion, but I had several issues when running it. First, I could not use an abbreviated file path to read the csv, but I was able to do so with the entire path, so that was the best that I could do. Next, I could only get code to run without errors for the parts: District Summary, School Summary, Highest and Lowest % Schools, Scores by School Size, and Scores by School Type. The other parts of the code ran with errors thrown. I am submitting the best of what I can do with this project for the time being.
